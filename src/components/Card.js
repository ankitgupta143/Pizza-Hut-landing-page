          <h1> Neapolitan Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            Neapolitan is the original pizza. This delicious pie dates all the
            way back to 18th century in Naples, Italy. During this time, the
            poorer citizens of this seaside city frequently purchased food that
            was cheap and could be eaten quickly. Luckily for them, Neapolitan
            pizza was affordable and readily available through numerous street
            vendors.

          <h1>Sicilian Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            Sicilian pizza, also known as "sfincione," provides a thick cut of
            pizza with pillowy dough, a crunchy crust, and robust tomato sauce.
            This square-cut pizza is served with or without cheese, and often
            with the cheese underneath the sauce to prevent the pie from
            becoming soggy.Sicilian pizzas are often topped with bits of tomato,
            onion, anchovies, and herbs.

          <h1>California Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            California pizza, or gourmet pizza, is known for its unusual
            ingredients. This pizza got its start back in the late 1970’s when
            Chef Ed LaDou began experimenting with pizza recipes in the classic
            Italian restaurant, Prego. He created a pizza with mustard, ricotta,
            pate, and red pepper, and by chance, served it to Wolfgang Puck

          <h1>Detroit Pizza</h1>
          <p>
            Reflecting the city’s deep ties to the auto industry, Detroit-style
            pizza was originally baked in a square automotive parts pan in the
            1940’s. Detroit pizza is first topped with pepperoni, followed by
            brick cheese which is spread to the very edges of the pan, yielding
            a caramelized cheese perimeter.
